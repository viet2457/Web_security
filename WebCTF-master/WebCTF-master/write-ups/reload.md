## Reload

On viewing the page source, we can see the text embedded "You are the xxxth visitor to this page. Every five hundredth visitor gets a prize."

So we can figure out that we need to reload this page that many times and we'll probably get the flag. Can you figure out a way to do that?

Hint : the <i>requests</i> library of python can make this task easy for you.
